Theory of revenue curves for startup revenue prediction ,

Predicting micro revenue growth
write research themed article . plot graphs for revenue for 10 year prediction




X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, Y1=Q1 REV, Y2=Q2 REV, Y3=Q3 REV, Y4=Q4 REV


Multiclass Regression Problem, 

Predicting 10 quarters revenue and then use that as an objective way to quantify the success of a startup.


Predicted x revenues of the startup.

cummulative sum of the predicted x revenues can then be their risk factor, If we predict a high
yield (return on investment) for the startup then that is a low risk. and conversely.


All parameters must be quantifiable
All data must be acccessible, in large scale ie

Quarterly returns, ...
